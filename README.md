# Clean code POC

Welcome on my Clean Code POC playground project, focused on iOS architecture.

## Project Visualization

Here is the UML diagram that provides a visual representation of the project's structure. Please note that it will evolve as the project progresses.

## Upcoming Topics

The following topics are planned for implementation in the near future:

- ~Use SPM instead of folders for API and Domain~
- ~Move sellers json into a remote server~
- ~Add mocks~
- ~Add unit tests on API and Domain~.
